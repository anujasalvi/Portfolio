# About me
I am Anuja Salvi, currently pursuing my masters in Infotrmation Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University. My background is as a data analyst/data scientist with a knack for design. 

# What I hope to learn
Through this course I hope to use my creative side and design insightful yet aesthetic visualizations that would not only be helpful for my career but would also reinitiate my love for art again.
