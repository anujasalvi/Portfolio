## Part 3: second data visualization using the same data

Paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well. Talk about why you chose the third data visualization. 

The first visualisation consisted of column chart where we can see the different ratios of different countries and compare them according to years. In the second visualization we see the trends of the ratios over the years for different countries in the form of a line chart. 
In the third visualization, I decided to choose a Hierarchy Bar chart with the animation to rank the countriews according to the years. We can also select the year manually if we want to see a particular year. In this chart specially, I chose to focus on USA, so as to compare its ratio with other countries and get a clear look of where USA stands when it comes to Genveral Government to Debt Ratio.
