# Assignment 2: Visualizing government debt

### _What is the data about?_
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.<sup>1</sup>

<br>
<p>The first visualisation consisted of column chart where we can see the different ratios of different countries and compare them according to years. In the second visualization we see the trends of the ratios over the years for different countries in the form of a line chart. 
In the third visualization, I decided to choose a Hierarchy Bar chart with the animation to rank the countriews according to the years. We can also select the year manually if we want to see a particular year. In this chart specially, I chose to focus on USA, so as to compare its ratio with other countries and get a clear look of where USA stands when it comes to Genveral Government to Debt Ratio. </p>
