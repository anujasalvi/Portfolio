  <p> 
    As my final project I am deciding to choose a topic really personal to me and something that I am really passionate about to spread more awareness about it. Hence, I am choosing to tell the story of <b><i>Mental Illnesses in Graduate Students</i></b>. For this topic I am going to outline the following points:
    <ul>
  <li>Understanding the prevalence and severity of mental health issues</li>
  <li>Understanding what students are thinking, feeling, and experiencing</li>
   <li>Understanding dfferent demographics of students with mental illnesses</li>
  <li>Making recommendations on steps programs can take to improve student mental health</li>
  
</ul><br>

        <b>Bar Graph of mental illnesses in Graduate Students.</b><br>
        In this graph I wanted to show the numbers depicting different illnesses in students. These numbers can also be in percentages. Additionally, we can also make it a grouped chart to see comparisons between average U.S. adult and students to know the severity of tis issue.<br>

<br>
  <p> 
    The data I wanted to use to effectively present this story was mostly survey and evidence based. Hence, most of them come from papers about already conducted surveys and research on mental well being and illnesses in graduate students. The survey results in these papers show an in depth analysis done on the students' mental well being while also mentioning the various demographics and background of the students that took the survey. The research papers that I would be referring too can be found <a href="https://github.com/anujasalvi/portfolio/tree/main/final%20project%20dataset" target="_blank">here</a>. These papers are from credible sources such as <a href="/final project dataset/2021-CCMH-Annual-Report.pdf" target="_blank">Center for Collegiate Mental Health, Penn State Uni</a>, <a href="/final project dataset/CICMH-Graduate-Student-Mental-Health_Toolkit.pdf" target="_blank">Centre for Innovation in Campus Mental Health (CICMH), Canada</a>, <a href="/final project dataset/bbb_mentalhealth_paper.pdf" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> and <a href="/final project dataset/NCHA-III_FALL_2021_REFERENCE_GROUP_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf" target="_blank">American College Health Association</a> to name a few. <br> 
    Additonally, facts and suggestions from articles like <a href="https://www.gograd.org/resources/grad-student-mental-health/" target="_blank">Mental Health in Grad School</a>, <a href="https://adaa.org/finding-help/helping-others/college-students/facts" target="_blank">Mental Health and College Students</a> and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-college-mental-health-crisis-focus-on-general_b_58bd93bce4b0ec3d5a6ba0ea" target="_blank">The College Mental Health Crisis</a> will also be used in my project.<br>
    I aim to create visuals with this data that would help the audience easily understand the severity of the situation and observe the trends that have been alarmingly increasing over the years. Also hoping to educate about mental illnesses in students like us and emphasisng the importance of being aware because this is something that is very common. Furthermore, I hope to provide some suggestions to the students as well as the programs.

<br>
  <p> 
    I plan to create the visuals using tools like Flourish and Tableau. I would want to incroporate and highlight the alarming numbers also showcasing various categories of illnesses and focusing on how sadly normal it is for graduate students. I also plan to use Shorthand to make a convincing story using this data while incorporating the visuals that I create hoping to effectively highlight the insights that I find using the data.

<summary><h2 style="display:inline-block">Peer Review Recommendations</h2></summary>
<br>
  <p> 
    In todays peer review I got some great recommendations that I would like to incorporate in my final project. Few of them is focusing on the age groups, gender and different demographics of the students. The other suggestion was to highlight the most prevalent major of students with mental illnesses. Additionally, an interesting recommendation was to include recommendations not only for the program but also for the students. As students they wanted to know how they could help with this existing issue.
