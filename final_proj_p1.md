  <p> 
    As my final project I am deciding to choose a topic really personal to me and something that I am really passionate about to spread more awareness about it. Hence, I am choosing to tell the story of <b><i>Mental Illnesses in Graduate Students</i></b>. For this topic I am going to outline the following points:
    <ul>
  <li>Understanding the prevalence and severity of mental health issues</li>
  <li>Understanding what students are thinking, feeling, and experiencing</li>
  <li>Making recommendations on steps students and programs can take to improve student mental health</li>
</ul><br>

        <b>Bar Graph of mental illnesses in Graduate Students.</b><br>
        In this graph I wanted to show the numbers depicting different illnesses in students. These numbers can also be in percentages. Additionally, we can also make it a grouped chart to see comparisons between average U.S. adult and students to know the severity of tis issue.<br>

<br>
  <p> 
    The data I wanted to use to effectively present this story was mostly survey and evidence based. Hence, most of them come from papers about already conducted surveys and research on mental well being and illnesses in graduate students. The survey results in these papers show an in depth analysis done on the students' mental well being while also mentioning the various demographics and background of the students that took the survey. The research papers that I would be referring too can be found <a href="/final project dataset" target="_blank">here</a>. These papers are from credible sources such as <a href="/final project dataset/2021-CCMH-Annual-Report.pdf" target="_blank">Center for Collegiate Mental Health, Penn State Uni</a>, <a href="/final project dataset/CICMH-Graduate-Student-Mental-Health_Toolkit.pdf" target="_blank">Centre for Innovation in Campus Mental Health (CICMH), Canada</a>, <a href="/final project dataset/bbb_mentalhealth_paper.pdf" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> and <a href="/final project dataset/NCHA-III_FALL_2021_REFERENCE_GROUP_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf" target="_blank">American College Health Association</a>to name a few. <br> 
    Additonally, facts and suggestions from articles like <a href="https://www.gograd.org/resources/grad-student-mental-health/" target="_blank">Mental Health in Grad School</a>, <a href="https://adaa.org/finding-help/helping-others/college-students/facts" target="_blank">Mental Health and College Students</a> and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-college-mental-health-crisis-focus-on-general_b_58bd93bce4b0ec3d5a6ba0ea" target="_blank">The College Mental Health Crisis</a> will also be used in my project.
