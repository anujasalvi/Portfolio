  <p> 
    As my final project I am deciding to choose a topic really personal to me and something that I am really passionate about to spread more awareness about it. Hence, I am choosing to tell the story of <b><i>Mental Illnesses in Graduate Students</i></b>. For this topic I am going to outline the following points:
    <ul>
  <li>Understanding the prevalence and severity of mental health issues</li>
  <li>Understanding what students are thinking, feeling, and experiencing</li>
  <li>Making recommendations on steps students and programs can take to improve student mental health</li>
</ul>
  </p>

        <b>Bar Graph of mental illnesses in Graduate Students.</b><br>
        In this graph I wanted to show the numbers depicting different illnesses in students. These numbers can also be in percentages. Additionally, we can also make it a grouped chart to see comparisons between average U.S. adult and students to know the severity of tis issue.<br>
