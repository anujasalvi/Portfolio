    As my final project I am deciding to choose a topic really personal to me and something that I am really passionate about to spread more awareness about it. Hence, I am choosing to tell the story of <b><i>Mental Illnesses in Graduate Students</b></i>. For this topic I am going to outline the following points:
    <ul>
  <li>)Understanding the prevalence and severity of mental health issues</li>
  <li>Understanding what students are thinking, feeling, and experiencing</li>
  <li>Maing recommendations on steps students and programs can take to improve student mental health</li>
</ul>
