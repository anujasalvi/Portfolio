    <br><b>Identifying as the audience for your final data story:</b><br>
    Since the test subject and the audience of my topic are students enrolled in graduate studies, my call to action is directed towards graduate students to not only start taking care of their own mental health, but to also pay attention to their friends, colleagues and fellow subordinates.
    
    <br><br><b>Narrowing the focus:</b><br>
    I initially had the approach of addressing everyone in the room for my call to action, although after my user research I thought of narrowing down my target audience to just graduate students as the people I surveyed for my user research were more interested in what they could do to help mitigate if not the issue as a whole, but at least the stigma around mental illnesses in students. 
    
    <br><br><b>Adjustments made to make it work for the audience:</b><br>
    I removed the section where I showed the demographics of the graduate students, for eg. how many percent of the students were international?, for the purposes of making the recommendations more as an umbrella solution which would be applicable to all graduate students as a community. Along with this I also added a section abpout how GPA affects mental health. Also my resources for recommendations are made more to-the-point than general advices.
    
    <br><br><b>Design decisions made:</b><br>
    While building my storyboard, I wanted to use interesting visualizations while still getting my point through the audience. I incorporated various charts from a simple bar chart to a spider chart also an alluvial diagram to catch the audiences' eye. Also having a consistent theme throughout my storyboard makes the various points addressed flow smoothly wihout feeling abrupt.
    
    <br><br><b>Additional information:</b><br>
    After many iterations to my storyboard, my final draft consists of the following flow/outline:
