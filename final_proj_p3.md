    <br><b>Identifying as the audience for your final data story:</b><br>
    Since the test subject and the audience of my topic are students enrolled in graduate studies, my call to action is directed towards graduate students for graduate students. 
    
    <br><br><b>Narrowing the focus:</b><br>
    I initially had the approach of addressing everyone in the room for my call to action, although after my user research I thought of narrowing doen my target audience to just graduate students as the people I survey were more interested in what they could do to help mitigate if not the issue as a whole, but at least the stigma around mental illnesses in students. 
    
    <br><br><b>Adjustments made to make it work for the audience:</b><br>
    I removed the section where I showed the demographics of the graduate students, for eg. how many percent of the students were international?, for the purposes of making the recommendations more as an umbrella solution which would be applicable to all graduate students as a community.
    
    <br><br><b>Design decisions made:</b><br>
    While building my storyboard, I came to know less is more. When it comes to colors I have limited them to few. When it coems to backgrounds, I have chose to stick with white, black and beige. And for visualizations I chose to go with a medium yellow color and keeping it constant for all the visualizations except for red and green when appropriate sentiment annotations are necessary.
    
    <br><br><b>Additional information:</b><br>
    After many iterations to my storyboard, my final draft consists of the following flow/outline:
    
    <ul>
  <li>Introducing fellow students to the topic</li>
  <li>Causes of mental illnesses in students</li>
  <li>Why are students exhuasted?</li>
  <li>Students' level satisfaction with life</li>
  <li>Stats about call for help by students</li>
  <li>Recommendations</li>
      
</ul>
