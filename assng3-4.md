  <p>This circle-packing diagram groups and counts a tabular dataset of <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub?state=All&fy=4&naics=All&items_per_page=10&page=1" target="_blank">Hâ€‘1B employers from 2019 provided on USCIS.</a></p>

  <p>When I first looked at this visualization my initial thought was "What is this? And my eyes hurt" This might be the best example of "TOO much data" in a visualization. There are too many circles which makes it hard to read any labels that exist in the graph. What the circles represent is also unknown due to a lack of title. And how the size of each circle is determined is also unknown. But being a member of the audience that would benefit the most with the H-1B Employer Data, I thought I need to refine this graph into something more suitable and legible for the audience.
