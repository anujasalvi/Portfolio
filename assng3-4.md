  <p>This circle-packing diagram groups and counts a tabular dataset of <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub?state=All&fy=4&naics=All&items_per_page=10&page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">H‑1B employers from 2019 provided on USCIS.</a></p>

  <p>When I first looked at this visualization my initial thought was "What is this? And my eyes hurt" This might be the best example of "TOO much data" in a visualization. There are too many circles which makes it difficult to read any labels that exist in the graph. What the circles represent is also unknown due to a lack of title. And how the size of each circle is determined is also unknown. But being a member of the audience that would benefit the most with the H-1B Employer Data, I thought I need to refine this graph into something more suitable and legible for the audience while also trying to deliver valuable insights that would be expected by them when they see a visualization on this subject.</p>

  <h4 style="display:inline-block">Data:</h4>
  <p>The visualization I chose to critique utitlized the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub?state=All&fy=4&naics=All&items_per_page=10&page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">H1-B Employer Hub Data 2019</a> from the official U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">USCIS</a>) site. Hence, making it even more important to be visualized effectively so as to deliver impactful insights.</p>
  <h4 style="display:inline-block">Critique:</h4>
  <p>As summarized above, it is not at all lucid what this graph wants to convey. Any person would have to spend a good 5 minutes to understand this visual (I know I did). And if any visualization requires more than a minute to understand what it wants to convey, there's not much use of the visual now is there? The lack of title, lack of legend, lack of colors, lack of the number of visas, lack of any information that would help me as an audience member to decode the goal of this graph makes me want to do a better job at graphing and displaying such important data to the core audience (which are majorly going to be students).<br>
    So when it comes to <b><i>Usefulness</i></b> and <b><i>Perceptibility</i></b>, the graph can be scord really less. While considering the <b><i>Completeness</i></b> of this visual, it might be <i>too</i> complete. The information is right, but the amount is not. Additionally,  context that’s needed to understand the information has not been provided either. <b><i>Truthfulness</i></b> of this visual is high, the data is accurate annd valid and every circle is accurately scaled. For obvious reasons, <b><i>Intuitiveness</i></b> and <b><i>Aesthetics</i></b> is ranked the lowest. <b><i>Engagement</i></b> is somewhere between "Distracts from data" and "Neutral". The graph does try to draw attention to the data, but the concentric circles also does tend to distract you.<br>
    Above all this, if any person having trypophobia was supposed to be a part of the audience, they would have a panic attack in a second of seeing this graph.
